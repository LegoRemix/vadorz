=Note=
This page describes how to build vadorz. If you just want to play the game, please see the Downloads tab.

= Introduction =
  # You need the ncurses library (if you are using Linux/BSD/+nix) or the pdcurses library (if you are using Windows).
  # You need a modern C compiler.
  # Download the source from SVN, or online.

= Compiling =
For gcc/ncurses:
 `$ gcc vadorz.c -O2 -lncurses -o vadorz`
 
For pdcurses: use -lcurses

= Running =
To play:
 `$ ./vadorz`
or
 `$ xterm -e ./vadorz`

Enjoy!
